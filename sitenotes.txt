create dynamic search form allowing buttons to click on names
create database to store users
create database of leagues


look at avatar content
http://materializecss.com/collections.html#!

create based on that for a selector for who you are playing against


//where i store all current user data
(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')))

next on the list:

create the user page, displaying basic information about them
- can probably take a look at how games and classes are structured, make it like that but with more info
-Got everything done except setting up filter
-Now have automatic filter

add leagues and by default filtering by them
- go based off of current user (or selected league)
- only allows users to record games with players in their league (should change to making a league selector only allows players in that league)
- need to add so that when a user is added to a league it records their name

make login bar part of header

set up filtering for games
- have filter by uid
- need by league - and have support for it on the main page

who is the winner is wrong
- was comparing strings not int values

        <input type="checkbox" name="h2h" value={this.state.checked} checked={this.state.checked} onChange={this.handleClick}/> Show only matches against you?<br />
	tried this for head to head, no success

sort by league on games page
- need to add list filter for uid
- done

add a me page in the header to view user profile
- done, but would like the text to flip between

need a refresh to keep current user updated
-? maybe lookup in header
- Seems to be unnecessary as long as site uses user lookup instead of actually pulling data from the storage

need head to head history
- when you view someone's page, add a toggle for head to head
- maybe have a page just for comparing records

rating system
- works but maybe display members of a league on the league page
- maybe add list of games played to the user on every game played


add a points in league and ranking system to each player

hosted on firebase


leaguedisplay not working with added leagues

Front page - like conversation with bartel
- display of top players
- quick add game button

dynamic header

must add yourself in a game

prompt players involved in game to validate
-did that
-just need to filter it within game displays to only show validated games

When you add a game you switch users? -fixed
Also subtraction only works sometimes - might be related - fixed
probably in the api - fixed
cannot add a game anymore after moving from api - seems fixed
only loads in stuff from google not the info from the database - fixed

loads users locally for full reference to current user


doubles apparently doesnt work anymore

Long term, possibly restructure, store game history in leagues not in its own tabel,
-push game id to each league (works right now because of cross referencing but is slightly clunky/innefficient)


---------------------------------------------
admin page
- remove a player from a league
- delete a user
- delete a game



add more stat tracking - average score, etc, breakdown by league, etc

change winner display

creation of sub leagues or tournaments within a league


table view? (like in guardian app)
-maybe make it an option in game creation? probably do it on a separate page though

cannot add a player more than once in a game
-on a backburner because not important for singles

private leagues

salting

????????????????

dancing log in button

------------------------------------

.filter(function(player){
          for ( var i in player.leagues){
            for( var j in user.leagues){
                if (user.leagues[j].value === player.leagues[i].value){

                return true;
              }
            }

          }
          return false;
        })

last thing to do, i am adding n=indexes to the league pages, need to add a score page any time i create a new table thing for it in my database do it doesnt start blank

also possible to disable live if league does not have live api

add league id to header and make it so that it can be updated from anywhere (duh)
