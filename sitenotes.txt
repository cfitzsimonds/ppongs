create dynamic search form allowing buttons to click on names
create database to store users
create database of leagues


look at avatar content 
http://materializecss.com/collections.html#!

create based on that for a selector for who you are playing against


//where i store all current user data
(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')))

next on the list:

create the user page, displaying basic information about them
- can probably take a look at how games and classes are structured, make it like that but with more info
-Got everything done except setting up filter
-Now have automatic filter

add leagues and by default filtering by them
- go based off of current user (or selected league)
- only allows users to record games with players in their league (should change to making a league selector only allows players in that league)
- need to add so that when a user is added to a league it records their name

make login bar part of header

set up filtering for games
- have filter by uid
- need by league - and have support for it on the main page

who is the winner is wrong
- was comparing strings not int values

        <input type="checkbox" name="h2h" value={this.state.checked} checked={this.state.checked} onChange={this.handleClick}/> Show only matches against you?<br />
	tried this for head to head, no success

sort by league on games page
- need to add list filter for uid
- done

add a me page in the header to view user profile
- done, but would like the text to flip between 

need a refresh to keep current user updated
-? maybe lookup in header
- Seems to be unnecessary as long as site uses user lookup instead of actually pulling data from the storage

need head to head history
- when you view someone's page, add a toggle for head to head
- maybe have a page just for comparing records

rating system
- works but maybe display members of a league on the league page
- maybe add list of games played to the user on every game played  


add a points in league and ranking system to each player

hosted on firebase


leaguedisplay not working with added leagues

Front page - like conversation with bartel
- display of top players
- quick add game button

dynamic header

must add yourself in a game

---------------------------------------------
admin page
- remove a player from a league
- delete a user
- delete a game



add more stat tracking - average score, etc, breakdown by league, etc

change winner display

prompt players involved in game to validate

creation of sub leagues or tournaments within a league

Long term, possibly restructure, store game history in leagues not in its own tabel, 
-push game id to each league (works right now because of cross referencing but is slightly clunky/innefficient)

table view? (like in their app)

cannot add a player more than once in a game


------------------------------------

.filter(function(player){
          for ( var i in player.leagues){
            for( var j in user.leagues){
                if (user.leagues[j].value === player.leagues[i].value){

                return true;
              }
            }

          }
          return false;
        })
