create based on that for a selector for who you are playing against


//where i store all current user data
(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')))

next on the list:

create the user page, displaying basic information about them
- can probably take a look at how games and classes are structured, make it like that but with more info
-Got everything done except setting up filter
-Now have automatic filter

add leagues and by default filtering by them
- go based off of current user (or selected league)
- only allows users to record games with players in their league (should change to making a league selector only allows players in that league)
- need to add so that when a user is added to a league it records their name

make login bar part of header

set up filtering for games
- have filter by uid

who is the winner is wrong
- was comparing strings not int values
