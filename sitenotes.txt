create dynamic search form allowing buttons to click on names
create database to store users
create database of leagues


look at avatar content 
http://materializecss.com/collections.html#!

create based on that for a selector for who you are playing against


//where i store all current user data
(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')))

next on the list:

create the user page, displaying basic information about them
- can probably take a look at how games and classes are structured, make it like that but with more info
-Got everything done except setting up filter
-Now have automatic filter

add leagues and by default filtering by them
- go based off of current user (or selected league)
- only allows users to record games with players in their league (should change to making a league selector only allows players in that league)
- need to add so that when a user is added to a league it records their name

make login bar part of header

set up filtering for games
- have filter by uid
- need by league - and have support for it on the main page

who is the winner is wrong
- was comparing strings not int values


---------------------------------------------
admin page
- add a league
- remove a player from a league
- delete a user
- delete a game

add a me page in the header to view user profile

need head to head history
- when you view someone's page, add a toggle for head to head

sort by league on games page
- need to add list filter for uid
- done

need a refresh to keep current user updated
-? maybe lookup in header


Long term, possibly restructure, store game history in leagues not in its own tabel
